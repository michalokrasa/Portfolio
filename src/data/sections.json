My go-to stack consists of React ecosystem on the frontend and node-based backend services written in typescript. So far, I've gathered remarkable experience creating headless e-commerce applications integrated with the most popular engines. Apart from that, I've had opportunities to work on admin panel application and custom streaming service solution."

I am responsible for the web application and backend infrastructure supporting our device. The project itself demands a wide variety of skills from 3D design, electronics and firmware to backend infrastructure and frontend web application. More than ten people are working on this system. Apart from the design and implementation of most backend and frontend parts, I am a leader of a group of five students that I successfully onboarded and taught the basics of working with Django."

I developed it in the scope of my engineering thesis and got the highest mark, together with the explicit appreciation for its research-based background. This project is the most complex system I have designed and developed. It comprises multiple services connected with docker and relies on audio processing algorithms that I did not know about before the project. I have greatly improved my data processing and docker-related skills with it. The system has been deployed to AWS cloud and the live view may still be accessible."

Having access to university time schedules of all the faculties and majors and attending courses from different levels and departments I have decided it is time to up my scheduling game. This project is a direct result of my approach to automation by tampering with google calendar API and Selenium scraping. I can't say it is a complete and bulletproof solution but it did its job fairly well. It was robust enough for me not to be afraid of missing any classes."

The project assumes developing an app that allows saving and managing different sources of learning materials like YT tutorials, e-books etc. Unfortunately, I had to abandon this project a while ago due to the lack of time but I am still in love with the simplicity of developing an Express backend. I hope to get back to working on it after finishing currently open projects."
